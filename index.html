                During my tenure at Deloitte as an Analyst from July 2021 to December 2022, I embarked on a dynamic and enriching journey that allowed me to apply and further develop my skills in the field of technology and business. As a member of the USI Digital Enablement Team, I was entrusted with significant responsibilities that encompassed various aspects of Salesforce development and system enhancement.
                <br><br>
                My role was characterized by a strong commitment to problem-solving and a deep dedication to improving system capabilities. I played a pivotal role in the successful development and deployment of diverse Salesforce functionalities, demonstrating my expertise in diagnosing, troubleshooting, and resolving technical issues. My approach involved a rigorous root cause analysis and problem-solving methodologies, ensuring that the system operated smoothly.
                <br><br>
                In addition to technical prowess, I actively contributed to decision-making through data-driven analysis, aligning our solutions with industry best practices. I was instrumental in guiding a Salesforce to ServiceNow Migration project, where I acted as the key point of contact, effectively managing communication and facilitating seamless collaboration between teams for a smooth transition.
                <br><br>
                My time at Deloitte also nurtured my research-oriented mindset, allowing me to streamline processes and author comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents. These documents not only promoted consistency and efficiency within the organization but also served as valuable references for future projects.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, I actively participated in fostering a positive and cohesive work environment within the Digital Enablement Team by organizing team-building activities. My experiences at Deloitte were instrumental in honing my professional skills and preparing me for future endeavors in academia and industry.

                In this academic project, I led the development of an end-to-end decentralized video conferencing application with advanced AI capabilities. The application aimed to provide users with a seamless and innovative video conferencing experience. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, and OpenAI, we incorporated features like facial analysis, speech-text conversion, and personalized attentiveness reports. This not only improved the quality of communication but also enhanced user engagement during video conferences. Additionally, we integrated Socket.IO and PyAudio to facilitate real-time communication improvements, ensuring smooth and efficient interactions among users.

                As a personal project, I designed and developed a personalized playlist generator that caters to individual user preferences. Using Python, I seamlessly integrated the spotipy library for Python and employed HTTP Requests to ensure secure user data retrieval and privacy. The goal was to create a music recommendation system that could curate playlists based on users' musical tastes and preferences. To accomplish this, a robust backend was created using Flask, a Python web framework, to handle user requests and interact with the Spotify Web API. This project not only demonstrated my programming skills but also my ability to build practical applications that enhance user experiences.
