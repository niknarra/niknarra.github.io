                As a personal project, I designed and developed a personalized playlist generator that caters to individual user preferences. Using Python, I seamlessly integrated the spotipy library for Python and employed HTTP Requests to ensure secure user data retrieval and privacy. The goal was to create a music recommendation system that could curate playlists based on users' musical tastes and preferences. To accomplish this, a robust backend was created using Flask, a Python web framework, to handle user requests and interact with the Spotify Web API. This project not only demonstrated my programming skills but also my ability to build practical applications that enhance user experiences.
